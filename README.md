This project focuses on the development of an interactive product interface for a line of wireless Bluetooth headphones. The primary goal is to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for customizing and purchasing headphones.

Implementation:

1. HTML Structure:

The HTML document defines the structure of the product page, including sections for images, product description, color and cable configuration options, and pricing.
Proper use of semantic HTML tags enhances accessibility and search engine optimization.

2. CSS Styling:

Utilizes a responsive design approach to ensure a consistent and visually pleasing experience across various devices.
Implements a clean and modern aesthetic with Roboto as the chosen font.
Makes extensive use of flexbox for layout and positioning, improving overall responsiveness.
3. JavaScript and jQuery:

Implements dynamic behavior using jQuery to enhance user interaction.
The script handles the color selection functionality, dynamically updating the displayed headphone image and applying the 'active' class for styling.
4. Product Customization:

Provides users with the ability to select headphone color and cable configuration.
Utilizes radio buttons for color options and buttons for cable configuration, enhancing user interactivity.
5. User Experience:

Focuses on creating an engaging and intuitive user experience.
Incorporates hover effects on buttons to provide visual feedback.
Responsive design ensures a seamless experience on devices of varying screen sizes.
Challenges Faced:

1. Responsive Design:

Adapting the interface for various screen sizes posed challenges in maintaining a consistent and visually appealing layout. Media queries were carefully used to address this issue.
2. Styling and Aesthetics:

Achieving a balance between a modern design and ensuring that the interface aligns with the brand's identity required iterative adjustments.
3. JavaScript Interaction:

Ensuring smooth and accurate color selection functionality through JavaScript and jQuery involved overcoming initial hurdles related to event handling and DOM manipulation.
